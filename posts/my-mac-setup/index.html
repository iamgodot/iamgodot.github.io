Coming from Arch with i3, I thought I’d get to this more UI-based and mouse-involved operating system, which seems like a degradation. However, after some digging, it becomes really comfortable for me being both elegant and efficient.\nGeneral setup I would skip the system settings part, where you may want to customize display, input methods, or modifier keys etc.\nPackage manager First of all, we need a proper tool to be in charge of all the installations, and Homebrew has been the de facto package manager for macOS since a very long time ago.\nIt’s worth noting that since 4.0.0, Homebrew finally ditches its intolerable low-speed updating by switching to JSON:\nToday, I’d like to announce Homebrew 4.0.0. The most significant change since 3.6.0 enables significantly faster Homebrew-maintained tap updates by migrating from Git-cloned taps to JSON downloads.\nWhich reminds me that this used to be a major reason for me not liking macOS. It always tried to update before executing every command, which was extremely inefficient.\nIn addition, there’s a new adopt option for brew install now, hence if you have already downloaded and installed something, you could let Homebrew take it over by brew install --adopt $APP.\nNow that we’re ready to install applications, I’d like to share my common list:\nLauncher: Raycast. I use this instead of Alfred.\nNote-taking\nLogseq: I keep everything here.\nObsidian: some features are amazing, e.g. the canvas drawing.\nNotion: great choice when it comes to sharing and co-working.\nBlogging\nMarkText: good replacement for Typora. PicGo: useful for uploading images to cloud storage. Mind mapping: MindNode. You can’t install this by Homebrew, but it’s definitely worth the trouble. The above mind map was made by this.\nMedia player: IINA. Open source, modern and smooth.\nScreenshot: Shottr. This supports scrolling screenshot.\nLauncher A good launcher is key to be efficient. Raycast comes with:\nLaunching\nApplications.\nFile search.\nOnline search.\nClipboard history: supports images as well.\nFloating note: very useful for quick noting.\nWindow management: easily arrange every window.\nUtils\nCheck other timezones.\nCheck currency rates.\nCalculations.\nIt also has many extensions, I mainly use:\nGitHub\nEasy dictionary\nEmoji search\nBesides, you can set alias and hotkeys for accessing all these functions to be just one or two keystrokes, such as f for file finding or g for Google searching.\nFinally, you can export and import a config file from Raycast, although for now they have to be done manually.\nDev setup Now that we finished everything as normal people, it’s time to open a terminal and play.\nBefore diving We need a good toolkit to start with, such as a friendly shell and a powerful editor.\nTo start with, I use Alacritty as my terminal emulator. It’s fast, and another good thing about it is you can customize by a simple config file with instant effect upon saving. See here for detailed configuration options.\nOn top of that, I always choose the classic combination:\nZsh: I use Ohmyzsh for its configuration and Powerlevel10k as theme. There are also nice alternatives, e.g. Starship.\nTmux: the terminal multiplexing is all good, except when restarting the machine, which makes Tmux-resurrect super useful.\nNeovim: check out my last post My Neovim Revamp.\nNow we can head out and prepare for coding, and I’m going to present for Python.\nPython MacOS has builtin Python installed, which we can call System Python. Besides, we need Dev Python, so that we can keep the former out of the hands of our projects.\nFor System Python, we leave the original one which resides in /usr/bin/python3 alone by introducing an installation via Homebrew. This System Python by Homebrew locates at /opt/homebrew/bin/python3, which in fact is a link and finally points to somewhere in the Cellar, e.g. /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3.11.\nFor Dev Python, we simply leverage on Pyenv. It allows us to keep multiple versions of Python and easily switch among them by commands, environment variables or special .python-version files.\nYou can read this blog for more on this topic.\nCLI tool Sometimes we want command line tools and we want them to be globally available, such as http by Httpie. In this case we should use Pipx, of which the slogan states:\nInstall and Run Python Applications in Isolated Environments.\nIt spares virtual environments for each application installed thus we can manage them effortlessly without worrying about dependency conflict.\nVirtual environment Finally we come to our projects. We choose a proper Python version via Pyenv, and the next step is to create a virtual environment.\nThere’re a lot of choices, and they’re still growing. I’ve tried the following:\nVirtualenv\nPipenv\nPew\nPoetry\nPDM\nEssentially a good one should satisfy 2 needs:\nPackage CRUD: installation, uninstallation, upgrade etc.\nVersion tracking: via whether requirements.txt or some other kind of lock files.\nIf you’re contributing to other projects, you may have to adapt to their selection. For myself, I use PDM currently for a few good reasons:\nIt’s based on a mature project and well-maintained.\nIt’s designed as smart and handy with elegant APIs.\nIt’s documented thoroughly.\nIt supports PEP 582.\nREPL Python developers are lucky to have IPython, and Jupyter levels things up further with web-based notebooks. Since JupyterLab depends on IPython, we can put them together:\n# This will expose ipython executable as well pipx install jupyterlab --include-deps ipython # Install a better dark theme in the same virtual environment pipx inject jupyterlab jupyterlab_materialdarker At last The above may seem a little overwhelming, and we certainly don’t want to repeat it every time on a new machine. I wrap things up in my dotfiles so that I can setup with just one command. Take a look for all the softwares and tips I mentioned.\nReferences\nmacOS Setup Guide\nBest Python Development Setup for 2022 and Beyond - laike9m’s blog\n","wordCount":"981","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-04-13T17:45:41+08:00","dateModified":"2023-04-13T17:45:41+08:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://iamgodot.com/posts/my-mac-setup/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Godot's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://iamgodot.com/icons/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://iamgodot.com accesskey=h title="Godot's Blog (Alt + H)">Godot's Blog</a>
