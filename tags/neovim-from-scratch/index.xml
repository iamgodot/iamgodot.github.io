I have been using VSCode for while, which is great with plugins like GitLens and Docker. Besides, it&amp;rsquo;s really handy to debug code, view all kinds of files and draw various diagrams such as UML. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d wave my hands to Neovim, however, I found I still need it, a lot.
Not trying to nitpick, but I have to switch between keyboard and mouse from time to time with VSCode, which sometimes can really interrupt my train of thoughts.</description></item></channel></rss>
