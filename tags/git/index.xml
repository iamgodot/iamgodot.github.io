&lt;h1 id="what-i-need">What I need&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This is so cruicial yet so hard that you might realize you&amp;rsquo;re diverting from it when working on the &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; part and have to start all over again. So seriouly, figure it out as much as you can in the first place.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Change the Capitalization of a Direcotry with Git</title><link>https://blog.iamgodot.com/posts/git-directory-capitalization/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2024 22:51:26 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://blog.iamgodot.com/posts/git-directory-capitalization/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I ran into a small issue with Git when I was trying to capitalize a directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Normally this should change the status of the repo so that I can make a commit, while Git just doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to pick up on it. After a little searching, I found the best way to resolve this was a simple config. According to Git&amp;rsquo;s documentation:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;code>core.ignoreCase&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If true, this option enables various workarounds to enable Git to work better on filesystems that are not case sensitive, like FAT. For example, if a directory listing finds &amp;ldquo;makefile&amp;rdquo; when Git expects &amp;ldquo;Makefile&amp;rdquo;, Git will assume it is really the same file, and continue to remember it as &amp;ldquo;Makefile&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
