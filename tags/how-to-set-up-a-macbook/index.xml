Coming from Arch with i3, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d get to this more UI-based and mouse-involved operating system, which seems like a degradation. However, after some digging, it becomes really comfortable for me being both elegant and efficient.
General setup I would skip the system settings part, where you may want to customize display, input methods, or modifier keys etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
